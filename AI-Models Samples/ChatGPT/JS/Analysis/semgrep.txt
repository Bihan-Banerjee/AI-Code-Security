          A CSRF middleware was not detected in your express application. Ensure you are either using one such
          as `csurf` or `csrf` (see rule references) and/or you are properly doing CSRF validation in your    
          routes with a token or cookies.

          Having default CORS settings is insecure because they often allow overly permissive cross-origin   
          access, exposing your application to unauthorized data sharing, potentially exposing sensitive data
          to malicious websites. Avoid using wildcard (*) origins, especially for endpoints that handle      
          sensitive data. Use a restrictive CORS policy by explicitly specifying trusted origins in the      
          Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
